## ‚úâÔ∏è Description
CaterApp is a cross platform, remotely data sharing tool created for sharing files in a quick and secured manner. It is aimed to integrate this tool with several more features including providing a User Interface.\
The _version 1.1_ of the CaterApp currently works with **command line interface** i.e. **CLI**.

### üí• What's so exciting ?  
CaterApp comes with a range of fantastic features for you:  
1. Share **any** type of file, including large videos and compressed documents.  
2. You can choose as much files as you want.  
3. Keeps you updated with the file, i.e. being shared in real time.  
4. Also, it displays the size of files (in bytes).  
5. Automatically detects sender's IP.  
6. Compresses multiple files before sending, if asked to do that.  
6. Tells the **speed** at which the data got delivered and a lot more...

## üìå Installation  
This is a `python` application that relies on its [**cater**](https://ravi-prakash1907.github.io/cater/) module.  

### ‚ùì Requirements  
1. A device with any operating system having bash / zsh terminal or python shell(preferred Linux)  
2. Python 3.2 or higher version  
3. pip (latest recommended)  

### ‚û° Steps to Install
Installation can be done through CLI in just a few of the simple steps:  

1. Either clone this repository or simply download the CaterApp-v1.1 here \([tar](https://github.com/ravi-prakash1907/CaterApp/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.tar.gz), [zip](https://github.com/ravi-prakash1907/CaterApp/archive/refs/tags/v1.1.zip)\)  
2. Extract the compressed file (if you have cloned/downloaded) and navigate into **CaterApp** directory  
3. Execute the `installer.sh` to install the application through following terminal command:  
```sh
$ ./installer.sh
```

2. All your received files will appear in **received/** directory at the current location. 
3. Both - the sender and reciever must be at the same network.
